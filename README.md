- 👋 Hi, I’m **@breeev** !
- 👀 I’m interested in **music** and everything about making it, producing it, coding it... Got a [Bandcamp](https://breee.bandcamp.com).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **networks & telecoms** / **cyberdefense**.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my Python **music generator** / **midi converter** project using [@hiromorozumi](https://github.com/hiromorozumi)'s [**BeepComp**](http://hiromorozumi.com/beepcomp) and its syntax ; I'm also looking for an **internship** for the next two years.
- 📫 How to reach me : message me on my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/breval-ferrari/) or use my [DuckDuckGo forwarder](mailto:breee@duck.com).  

Thanks to `Joe's alt#0595` on Discord for the pfp!
